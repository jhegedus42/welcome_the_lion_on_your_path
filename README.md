# This is a description on how I use docker to develop this repo.

These script files to develop a docker image which can be used for
Stan and related programming (it is supposed to be something that 
works out of the box for ML and particalarly for Scala and Stan).

Part of the goal is to compile Stan to JS.

The good stuff:

 - `tmux` 
 - `mc` 
 - `git` f
 - `node.js` 
 - `python`
 - `em++` 
 - `clang` 

This list should grow.

Quickstart:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:jhegedus42/wellcome_the_lion_on_your_path.git
$ cd docker
$ docker pull jhegedus42/welcome_the_lion_on_your_path
$ ./start.sh
$ tmux
$ mc
